# ia-audio-uploader

This is my attempt at a simple uploader for files to Internet Archive using their python library, *internetarchive*.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required.
* python-internetarchive *(For the obvious reasons)*
* python-tinytag *(For pulling metadata info from audio files)*

Be certain to change the variable at the top of the file.
